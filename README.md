# Syringe Pump

The Syringe Pump is a 3D Printed fluid dispenser I developed during
summer 2018 while working at the BioElectrics laboratory in the Neurosurgery department
at Anshutz Medical school at CU Denver.

The syringe pump is controlled by a Raspberry Pi Zero W. This repository contains code running
on the Pi.
